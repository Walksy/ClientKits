# Store and load your custom kits!

This mod allows you to save kits from your inventory and transfer them across to singleplayer, and other multiplayer servers.


### How To Use:
After correctly installing the mod, you will now have access to the following commands in-game:
- **/ck save [Name]:**
  
  This will save your current inventory to file, with the chosen name.

- **/ck load [Name]:**
  
  This load the selected kit.

- **/ck delete [Name]:**
  
  This will delete the chosen kit.

- **/ck preview [Name]:**
  
  This will open a fake inventory for you to preview and see the saved kit.


### Important Info:
- To load a kit, you must have access to creative mode, whether that's on a singleplayer world or a multiplayer server. However, you can still preview, save, and delete your kits regardless of your mode.

- All saved kits will be put in the kit config folder, located .minecraft/config/ClientKits. This enables you to easily share your individual kits with other players.

- After deletion, a kit is permanently removed. However you can always create backups to ensure you never lose your kits!

### Known Bugs (ALL FIXED):
- ~~When saving a kit on a different version, attempting to load it on a version that is either lower or higher will result in the kit not loading.~~
